Parameters ¶
» RFC 6265 provides the normative reference on how each setcookie() parameter is interpreted.

name
The name of the cookie.

value
The value of the cookie. This value is stored on the clients computer; do not store sensitive information. Assuming the name is 'cookiename', 
this value is retrieved through $_COOKIE['cookiename']

expires
The time the cookie expires. 
This is a Unix timestamp so is in number of seconds since the epoch. 
In other words, you'll most likely set this with the time() function plus the number of seconds before you want it to expire. 
Or you might use mktime(). time()+60*60*24*30 will set the cookie to expire in 30 days. If set to 0, or omitted, 
the cookie will expire at the end of the session (when the browser closes).


Here's an example that uses setcookie() function to create a cookie named username and assign the value value John Carter to it. 
It also specify that the cookie will expire after 30 days (30 days * 24 hours * 60 min * 60 sec).
