JavaScript Comments
Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Comments are NOT Executed</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x;
x = 5;
// x = 6; I will not be executed
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>
