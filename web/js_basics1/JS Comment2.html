JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 id="myH"></h1>
<p id="myP"></p>

<script>
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

</body>
</html>
