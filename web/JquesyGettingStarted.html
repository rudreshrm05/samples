jQuery Get Started


Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google
Downloading jQuery
There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)
Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, 
and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

<head>
<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>



jQuery CDN
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.

To use jQuery from Google or Microsoft, use one of the following:



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("button").click(function(){
        $("p").hide();
    });
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<h2>This is a heading</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<button>Click me</button>

</body>
</html>
