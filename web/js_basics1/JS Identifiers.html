JavaScript Identifiers
Identifiers are names.

In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).

The rules for legal names are much the same in most programming languages.

In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

NOTE:
Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.


JavaScript is Case Sensitive
All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript is Case Sensitive</h2>

<p>Try change lastName to lastname.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = lastname;
</script>

</body>
</html>
