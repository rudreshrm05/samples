JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.

Alert Box
An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.

Syntax

window.alert("sometext");

The window.alert() method can be written without the window prefix.
