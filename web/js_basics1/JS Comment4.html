Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 id="myH"></h1>
<p id="myP"></p>

<script>
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myp"
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

</body>
</html>
