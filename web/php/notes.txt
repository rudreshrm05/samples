following are some rules that must be followed while using the variables
1. The variables must start with letter or _ but it shuld not begin with a num.
2. It consists of alpha numeric chars or _.
3. There should not be space in the name of the variable.
4. while assigning the values to the variable the variable must start with $.
	
	ex: $marks=100;
	
Displaying messages on web page:

In php the op can be displayed using two statements-

1. print 
2. echo

using the unset() we can create gaps in the PHP array.
we can use array_values() to adjust these gaps by subsequent element.
print_r() can be used to display the array elements.

Array sorting:

sorting is processs in which the elements of the array can be sorted in some
specific order.
there are 2 types of ordering which are follwed in sorting
1. Ascending
2. Descending

PHP uses sort() for sorting array elements.

asort() sorts the array by values, but the original keys are kept.

ksort() sorts the array by keys, but each value's original key is retained.

Super global arrays:
 The super global arrays are special predefined vars in PHP. These vars
 allow th eprogammer to easily access http headers, query string paramaters.

$_GET and $_POST

create  a form containing information serial num, title of the book,
pubilshers, quantiyy, price. Read the data from the form and display it using php script.  

Write a php pgm to accept a +ve integer n through an html form and to display the
sum of all nums from 1-n.

Date object:

used to obtain the date and time

String object:

String is a collection of chars.
In JS using String obj many useful string related functionalities can be
performed.

EX;

Object creation and modification:
 The web designer can create an object and can set its properties as per
gis requirement.
The obj can be  created using the new keyword.
The obj with no prop can be set using the foll statements:

Myobj=new object();

Then using the . operator we can set the properties for that obj.
The obj can then be modified by assigning the values to this obj.

EX:

Event types:
 EX on event handling.
1. Handling events from <body>

The onload event gets activated as soon as the web page gets loaded in the 
browser's window.
The following scripts illustrates the onload tag attribute.

2. Handling events from button elements.

JS to validate a form consisting of user name, age, hobby, gender, address, Email
(checkbox),country(dropdown box)

$_FILES

is an associated array updated.......

the input type="file"

element is used to create the user interface for uploading a file from the client to 
the server.

HTML required for file upload:
following stepa are req to upload a file

1. Make use of HTTP POST() as transmitting a file through URL.
2. Add the enctype="multipart/form-data" attr to the heml form ie performing the uload so that
 the http req can submit multiple pcs of data.
3. Finally include input type="file".


1.A web app consists of series of disconnected http req to web server where each req for server page is basically
a req to run a seperate pgm 
2. There many occations where we want the web server to connect the req together for instance in an application like
online purchasing sys, the user adds an item to the cart, makes online payment and then checks out.
In this situation the web server should recognize that the req is from the same individual and these 
are alltogether th subsequent req to perform the single task of online purchase.
3. These req are made by usig http protocol. The drawback of this protocol is that it cannot recognize 
that req that are coming to the web server are from single src or from two diff srcs. Hence http is 
also called as stateless protocol. It cannot remember from which user the req has come from.
To overcome this drawback of http there are variety of solns. Out of which the most commanly used tech of 
passing info from one req to another to another are
1. using query string 
2. using URL path
3. cookies
4. session handling

PASSING INFORMATION VIA QUERY String

There are two methods
1. GET 
2. POST
FOr passing the query string from browser to server.
Method get is used to send the query which is less secure.
Method post is used to send most secure data.

Working of GET and POST:

If we have a input form on which there are some textboxes placed, the user fills up the
information whithin the text boxes and clicks the submit button.
The information within the text boxes will then be transmitted to the server, via query string

Difference between get and post

GET																POST
1.Parameters remain in browser history          1.Parameters are not saved in the browser history
because they are part of the URL.
2. GET is less secured compared to POST         2. POST is little safer than GET, because 
because data sent is part of URL.                parameters are not stored in browser historyory
SO, It is saved in browser history.
3. this request can be cached.                
4. This request can be bookmarked               4.This request cant be bookmarked
5. GET method should not be used while
sending password or other sensitive info.       6. Used while sending sensitive info.
6. Only limited amount of info sent using 
get request
7. MOre efficient.                              7.Less Efficient

JQUERY foundation:

Including jquery in your page
1.Since the entire lib exists as an src JS file, importing jquery for use in our application
is as easy as including a link to a file in the <head> of html page.
2. There a number of ways to do this
	a. We can download it from JQUERY site and load it into the page from the web server.
	b. We can use a content delivery ntwrk(CDN) to supply it from its server.
	
	ex:
	For google - easiest way to try JQUERY is to add this line 

<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("button").click(function(){
        $("h2").hide();
    });
});
</script>
</head>

basically the jqury is written in the foll form:
$(selector).action()

The  $ denotes acces to the JQUERY.
The action denotes the actions to be performed on selector elements.

The load() loads data from the server and puts th returned data into the selected element.
Syntax: load()
$(selector).load()

Basic selectors:
1. Element selector

Script explanation:
In the above code, withi the ready() the JQ code is written.
For the button element selector the action is click. This action invokes the <h2> and the actioN
associated with the element is hide(), this means that when the user clicks the button 
the text written within the <h2> will be hidden.

2. ID selector

The id can be associate with the html element.
In the foll ex we have used <p> to which the id named 'test' is associated.
On button click event the function is invoked to hide the sentence written using the <p>.
To find the element with particular id write # and the name if the id.

3. Class selector

The class selector is also used to find the specific html element. The element is written
along with class="classname" and to find this element write a . folowed by class name.

4. * as a selector

* means all. If we include selector as * then the corresponding will be associated with all 
the html elements.

5. The href selector

[href]

6. Contextual selector 

To change the style the .css() function is used.
syntax:

$(selector).css({"css property name":"css property value"});

Form selectors:

The form html element is used to collect and transmit data, there are JQ selectors written
espically for them.
These selectors are listed below:

$(:button)- selects all the buttons
$(:reset)- selects all the reset buttons
$(:submit)- selects all the submit buttons
$(:checkbox) - selects all the CBs
$(:radiobutton)- selects all the RBs

JQ listeners:

1. JQ allows the management of events.
2. The $(document).ready() is used in JQ allows to execute a function when the document is fully
loaded.
