What is an Array?
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

var car1 = "Saab";
var car2 = "Volvo";
var car3 = "BMW";
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.


Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];    


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Arrays</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;
</script>

</body>
</html>
